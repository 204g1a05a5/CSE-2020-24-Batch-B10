## Title : Detection Of Anomalous Behaviour In An Examination Hall Towards Automated Proctoring 
### Abstract :
*The rise of online education has brought forth new challenges in maintaining the integrity of remote examinations. To address this, automated proctoring systems have emerged, leveraging advanced technologies to monitor and detect unusual behaviors during online exams. This project focuses on developing an automated proctoring system that employs computer vision, machine learning, and behavioral analysis to identify behaviors such as impersonation, cheating, unauthorized device usage, and abnormal interactions with the exam environment. The system aims to provide real-time alerts to proctors or administrators, ensuring fair and secure online assessments while respecting privacy and minimizing false positives. This solution contributes to upholding the credibility of remote exams in the digital education landscape.*
